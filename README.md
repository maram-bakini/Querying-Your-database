Welcome to the SQL Chatbot project! This application allows users to interact with a SQL database through a conversational AI interface. Using Gemini Pro—an open-source large language model (LLM)—this chatbot converts natural language questions into SQL queries, connects to a database, and retrieves answers for the user. This project is built for accessibility, enabling non-technical users to explore and understand data without needing SQL expertise.
